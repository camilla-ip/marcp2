# MARC Phase 2 analysis scripts

This repository contains the scripts required to re-create the MARC Phase 2 analyses described in:

Jain M, Tyson JR, Loose M, Ip CLC, Eccles DA, O\'Grady J, Malla S, Leggett RM, Wallerman O, Jansen HJ, Zalunin V, Birney E, Brown BL, Snutch TP, Olsen HE, MinION Analysis and Reference Consortium. MinION Analysis and Reference Consortium: Phase 2 data release and analysis of R9.0 chemistry [*F1000, in submission*]

## Installation

Download this source hierarchy:

```
cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPTS
git clone git@github.com:camilla-ip/marcp2.git
```

Then follow instructions in the Revision1 sub-directory README file.

## Revision 1 analysis

The study was an analysis of 5 experiments:
- 1x 2D library run on R7.4 chemistry (data from the MARC Phase 1 study)
- 2x 2D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data produced for this study)
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data produced this study)

To replicate the MARC Phase 2 Revision 1 analysis, please follow the instructions in /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPTS/Revision1/README.md

It describes the third-party software required, how to test the scripts on a tiny sub-sample of the data, how to download the raw experimental data and run the analysis scripts.
