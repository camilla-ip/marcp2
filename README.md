# MARC Phase 2 analysis

This repository contains the scripts required to re-create the MARC Phase 2 analyses described in:

Jain M, Tyson JR, Loose M, Ip CLC, Eccles DA, O'Grady J, Malla S, Leggett RM, Wallerman O, Jansen HJ, Zalunin V, Birney E, Brown BL, Snutch TP, Olsen HE, Minion Analysis and Reference Consortium. MinION Analysis and Reference Consortium: Phase 2 data release and analysis of R9.0 chemistry [*F1000, in submission*]

Revision 1

The Revision1 directory contains detailed instructions for downloading the raw data, software pre-requisites, setting up an analysis directory and running the scripts.

The study compares 5 experiments:
- 1x 2D library run on R7.4 chemistry (data from the MARC Phase 1 study)
- 2x 2D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data in this study)
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data in this study)

The directory also contains a reduced data set for testing the scripts work.
