# MARC P2 analysis

This repository contains instructions and scripts for running the
analyses presented in the MARC Phase 2 data release paper.

The analysis.md file contains detailed instructions on how to download
and set up the raw data, run the data pre-processing steps, generate
the data presented in the paper and generate the figures presented in the
paper:

XXXX CITATION

The analysis presented here assumes analysis of 5 experiments:
- 1x typical 2D library run on R7 chemistry (from the MARC Phase 1 paper);
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9 chemistry
- 2X 2D libraries run on R9 chemistry

The scripts are general enough to enable comparison of other R7 and R9 experiments, but has only been tested when there are exactly 5 input experiments.
