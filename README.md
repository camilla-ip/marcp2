## Installation

Download this source hierarchy:

```
cd /PATH/TO/YOUR/SCRIPTS
git clone git@github.com:camilla-ip/marcp2.git
```

Then follow instructions in the Revision1 sub-directory README file.

## Revision 1 analysis

The study was an analysis of 5 experiments:
- 1x 2D library run on R7.4 chemistry (data from the MARC Phase 1 study)
- 2x 2D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data produced for this study)
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data produced this study)

This sub-directory contains detailed instructions for downloading the raw data, software pre-requisites, setting up an analysis directory and running the scripts. It also includes a tiny sub-sample of the data to test the scripts are working.
