This repository contains instructions and scripts for running the
analyses presented in the MARC Phase 2 data release paper:

XXXX CITATION

The analysis.md file contains detailed instructions on how to download
and set up the raw data, run the data pre-processing steps, generate
the data presented in the paper and generate the figures presented in the
paper.

The scripts compare 5 experiments:
- 1x 2D library run on R7 chemistry
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9 chemistry
- 2X 2D libraries run on R9 chemistry

The code can be used to compare other data, but has only been tested when there are exactly 5 experiments.
