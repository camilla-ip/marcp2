git clone git@github.com:camilla-ip/marcp2.git
```

## Revision 1 analysis

The study was an analysis of 5 experiments:
- 1x 2D library run on R7.4 chemistry (data from the MARC Phase 1 study)
- 2x 2D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data produced for this study)
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new data produced this study)

The Revision1/README.md file describes the third-party software required, how to test the scripts on a tiny sub-sample of the data, how to download the raw experimental data and run the analysis scripts.
