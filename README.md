# MARC Phase 2 analysis

This repository contains the scripts required to re-create the MARC Phase 2 analyses described in:

Jain M, Tyson JR, Loose M *et al.* MinION Analysis and Reference Consortium: Phase 2 data release and analysis of R9.0 chemistry [*in submission*]

The scripts compare 5 experiments:
- 1x 2D library run on R7.4 chemistry (from the MARC Phase 1 study)
- 2x 2D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new)
- 2x 1D libraries run on R9.0 chemistry (new)

The Revision1 directory contains detailed instructions for downloading the raw data, software pre-requisites, setting up an analysis directory and running the scripts.
